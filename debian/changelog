sflvault-common (0.7.8~ppa1) lucid; urgency=low

    * Released 0.7.8
    * Upgrading:
    ** When upgrading to this version, the password stored in your Keyring will be invalidated, since a new standard and Windows-compatible way to store the password.  You should search for domain "sflvault". Under Ubuntu, it's in the "network credentials" section.
    * Added 'content' protocol handler, which will store a blob of content as the service secret.
    * Added 'sflvault' protocol handler, which inherits 'content' (to store another vault's credentials)
    * Added support to add a port-forwarding as part of an alias
    * Major improvements to the QT client:
    ** Save password in QT client
    ** Main window remembers position and size
    ** Fixed #3682: password show error
    ** Added desktop file
    ** Merged in Microsoft Windows version compatibility (should work, but more testing is needed)
    ** Updated protocol window to split arguments from the executable.
    ** Simplified service config interface
    ** Better error handling
    ** Revamped info-dock for a service, machine and customer.
    ** Added support for metadata.
    * Added a minimal but important test suite
    * Results are now sorted when searching (by machine name, and service URL)
    * Added basic logging to the server
    * Added support for metadata, for each service, with the first key, "prompt", being used by the 'sudo://', 'su://', and 'ssh://' handlers, to detect the shell prompt you'll be waiting for.  For the cases where the provided regexp weren't matching your shell.  The value for "prompt" should be a regular expression.

    * Plugins system layed out
    * SFLvault-common and SFLvault-client required for client
    * SFLvault-common and SFLvault-server required for server
  * Fixed double authentication on `show` and `connect`

    * Output is always UTF-8
  * DEFAULT SERVER CONFIG IS NOW SSL ENABLED.
    * Clients will have to switch to https instead of http

  * Most of the functions now ask for a -u when specifying a user, a -c when specifying a customer
    * "user-del -u user" instead of "user-del user"
    * "customer-del -c customer", "machine-del -m machine", "service-del -s service", "group-del -g group"
  * `show` now shows detailed view by default, and will quiet down with `-q`.
    * This includes listing the services' groups
  * Added connect -a | --alias, which will add an alias while connecting
    * Equivalent to "alias <something> <vault_id>" and then "connect <vault_id>"
  * Added connect -s, which will execute a "show <vault_id>" before connecting
  * Search now reports customers or machines even if no services are attached to them.
  * Added support for identities
    * Running @sflvault -i something@ will use @~/.sflvault/config.something@ as a config file.

    * Services can request port-forwarding for functioning
    * The `connect` command now support:
      * @connect s#123 -- -L 1234:localhost:80@ and will forward through multiple hops, the right ports to the right places
  * Added search in machines, and in customers, in addition to searching in groups.
    * `search -m 123 key words` or `search -c 123 key words`, or a mix of both.

  * Implemented SFLvault Fall-back shell.
    * Access with Ctrl+Alt+; while in an `ssh` session.
